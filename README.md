A TableDrawer using Canvas and save the img as png file from the specific format of the text.

I wrote it for my own blog use since the Markdown seems do not support the table generated.

Chinese/Japanese character supported.

The second js app I've ever wrote.

I'll be glad if someone could give me advice on my program with best practice in javascript.

You can have a glance at this program with the link below :

Thanks to [nihilogin](http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/) for providing a converter from canvas to img file. This solves the problem of non-firefox browser.
